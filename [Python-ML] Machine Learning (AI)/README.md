### Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN)

This project focused on creating a Deep Q-learning network (DQN) to train a pirate agent to find the treasure (goal), using the shortest possible path. The provided environment (TreasureEnvironment.py) was given and included a maze matrix, reset position function, state updates, rewards, actions, game status, and graphical visualization. Experience replay functionality was provided in the GameExperience.py module and facilitated storage for episodes in memory, tracking all states from initial to terminal, and predicting the next action based on the current environment state. Along with these elements, the build model and tests for winning the game were included prior to coding the DQN. 

Computer scientists solve problems using creative and technical solutions. To create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, you must write code using proper, consistent naming conventions and keep functions short and concise. It is also recommended to modularize your code to provide easier maintainability and reusability. I created names that clearly described variables and functions. In object-oriented programming (OOP), you should implement the principles of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Developers should thoroughly comment code using industry-standard best-practices to make the code easily comprehendible and maintainable. 

Software developers play a critical role in this world, and the job should be taken very seriously. Through hard work and perseverance, innovations in technology are constantly emerging. As a computer scientist, the following regulations and guideliness should be adhered to:
  •	IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
  •	ISO (International Organization for Standardization): ensures quality, safety, and  efficiency
  •	W3C (World Wide Web Consortium): develops web standards
  •	ANSI (American National Standards Institute): oversees creation of norms and guidelines
  •	NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology): promotes innovation and industrial competitiveness
  •	ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
  •	Markkula Center for Applied Ethics: offers resources on ethics in professional and corporate settings
